# Market basic actions

You can **create** (mint) new tokens, uploading their image and metadata on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).  
If you've created or bought an NFT, you may also **sell** it by setting a price and paying a listing fee.  
When **buying** an NFT, the price will be transferred to the seller and the listing fee to the NFT Marketplace owner.  
It's also possible to **cancel** a market item, transferring it back to the owner.
